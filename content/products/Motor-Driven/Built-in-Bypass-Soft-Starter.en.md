### Product Overview

![Built-in Bypass Soft-Starter](/images/Built-in-Bypass-soft-starter/1.jpg)
This series of soft starters adopts a three-input and three-outlet structure design, and the complete set of cabinets does not need an external AC contactor; the interior uses a three-phase independent bypass contactor DC coil design to ensure that it is not affected by voltage drop and thus ensures reliable operation of the equipment! Small and classic, with perfect motor comprehensive protection function! This product is widely used in the starting control of transmission equipment, fans, pumps, crushers and other loads. The product complies with GB14048.6-2016

> The soft starter design concept adheres to the principle of reliability, ease of use, practicality and low overall cost. The comprehensive cost mentioned here includes: manufacturing cost, on-site commissioning cost, fault diagnosis cost, after-sales service cost, etc. The specific features are listed below

1. The screen displays a large amount of information, which is convenient for remote diagnosis and analysis, and reduces the cost of fault resolution caused by miscalculation, including round-trip travel expenses

2. Externally adapted N/5 current transformers, compared to N/1 or N/0.1 transformers, market versatility, convenient after-sales maintenance.

3. The thyristor driver circuit adopts pulse transformer to reduce the damage of the circuit board caused by poor conduction of thyristors.

4. There is no need to calibrate the current in the field. The V3 soft starter abandons the previous method of adapting the current sampling resistance to different power starter cabinets. The biggest disadvantage of the original method is that when matching different power cabinets, the current sensing resistance needs to be changed, and it often needs to be calibrated in the field. The V3 soft starter can be matched to the respective power cabinet only by means of a transformer ratio setting. Because of its versatility, it is greatly convenient for the whole machine factory stocking and on-site after-sales service personnel.

5. The trigger circuit is powerful and can be used with thyristors with trigger currents up to 100mA. Expand the adaptation range of thyristors, and also facilitate the selection of the whole machine factory.

6. All relays can be programmed for flexible response to user requirements.

7. Set the starting and stopping methods of panel buttons and terminal blocks (jogging, soft starting, soft stop combinations) respectively, which can cope with some special requirements.

8. A true two-wire approach. Two-wire control, start-stop mode wiring is extremely simple. In general, this start-stop method is especially suitable for float water supply applications.

9. Two starting methods: voltage start, current limit start.Voltage starting mode, similar to autocoupling starting or star-delta starting. However, it is especially suitable for occasions where the on-site power supply is relatively "soft": the starting voltage output to the motor at starting is not affected by the input voltage, but only depends on the set starting voltage (except for the power supply voltage < the starting voltage). It can reduce the unnecessary "slope climbing" time, reduce the high current heating time when the motor is started, and facilitate the rapid completion of the starting process;The current-limiting starting method is suitable for occasions where the starting current is relatively small on site. The average current of the three phases during the whole process of starting does not exceed the set value.

10.  Triac current limiting function. During the entire starting, running and soft-stop process, the current is monitored at any time not exceeding the nominal current of the thyristor. Minimize thyristor damage due to overcurrent.

11. Accurate fault location. For example, when phase loss can occur, in addition to locating the phase of phase loss, it is also located to locate whether it is input phase loss or output phase loss. It is convenient for users to find the source of the fault on site.

12. Has a record of downtime information. The record contains information such as input voltage, output voltage, current of each phase, shutdown source, and fault cause at the shutdown time. With such records, a standardized description of communication can be established between users and service providers. Avoid waste caused by poor information communication. When encountering difficult and complicated diseases such as on-site starting difficulties and inexplicable shutdown, calling the information of this specification is conducive to rapid communication and understanding of the on-site situation, which greatly facilitates the solution of faults and remote analysis and diagnosis. So that targeted measures can be taken to solve problems quickly.

13. In order to quickly and easily identify common faults on site, a "toolbox" is specially designed. There are port tests, power supply tests, and thyristor short-circuit tests in the toolbox. Convenient diagnosis of on-site conditions.

14. It has complete protection functions. And all protection functions can be turned off to meet the urgent needs of the site.

15. The parameter setting menu is designed to be simple and easy to understand. Each related parameter is grouped and classified, and the relevant parameters are attached to the main parameter, which is convenient for the relevant parameters to be set at one time and can avoid missing the setting of the associated parameters.
